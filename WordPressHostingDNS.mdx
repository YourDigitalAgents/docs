Hey, \
\
To push the site live, simply replace the current A record and CNAME as below: \
\
<u>A Record</u>\
Name: **@**\
Value: **34.149.86.124**\
\
<u>CNAME Record</u> (Make sure their is no multiple CNAME with the same host)\
Name: **www**\
Value: [**host.websiteprohosting.com**](http://host.websiteprohosting.com)\
\
Note: It is imperative to ensure the backup of current DNS records to mitigate any potential downtime that could affect other services associated with the domain. \
